Installation instructions
=========================

There are two ways to install this application for use by your
projects; the first is to do a Subversion checkout::

    git clone https://github.com/elo80ka/django-dynamic-formset

The second method is to download a packaged release. The latest
release is 1.1. You can download the source and documentation only,
or include the demo project::

    wget http://django-dynamic-formset.googlecode.com/files/jquery.formset-1.1.zip
    unzip jquery.formset-1.1.zip -d jquery.formset-1.1
    cd jquery.formset-1.1

The plugin files are in the ``src/`` directory. If you downloaded
the archive with the demo project, you'll need to set it up first.


Setting up the demo project
===========================

The demo project is a Django project, showing different ways to
use the plugin. To run the project, you'll need Python_ and Django_.
For instructions on installing them, see their respective sites.

Once you've got the source code, run the following commands to set up the
SQLite3 database and start the development server::

    cd demo
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    chmod a+x manage.py
    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py runserver
